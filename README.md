# New Developer Training

This is a new developer training session that will conclude with a Pull Request (PR) to the [GpgKee]() project.  The PR is simple enough, but since the project is related to encryption and passwords, it serves as a good introduction to the concept.  Most of this session will be spent on foundational work, with less time actually spent on the actual coding.

The basic outline of the training sessions will consist of the following:

1. [Learn Foundational Basis of Security](foundation.md)
2. [Learn Shell Programming](shell.md)
3. [Learn the GnuPG Application]()
4. [Learn the Veracrypt Application]()
5. [Learn the KeePass Application]()
6. [Learn the OpenSSH Platform]()
7. [Learn GIT and GitHub Platforms]()
8. [Learn the Visual Studio Platform]()
9. [Learn the C# Programming Language]()
10. [Learn the GpgKee GitHub Project]()
11. [Submit a PR for an improvement to GpgKee]()
12. [Learn the Docker Build environment]()
13. [Optimize GpgKee build environment to make it Deterministic]()


Most of these sessions will be self paced and reference training from Microsoft, or other respected groups.  If the student does not yet have a Microsoft account at Microsoft.com or GitHub.com those will need to be created.  Most colleges include Microsoft membership as part of standard tuition, and those accounts seem to work well in the Microsoft Training environment.

Most of these sessions will focus on Windows and Linux, though much of the Linux work will be through Microsoft WSL Linux distributions.  Alternatively you can do many of these sessions in virtual environments (VPCs).  To that effect, Microsoft offers student kits at both [Github](
https://education.github.com/pack
) and [Microsoft](
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/student-hub/
), both of which come with free hours of time on Azure for virtualization.

As you progress through the training, you can use either the [discussion section]() or [issue submission]() to bring questions or concerns to light.
