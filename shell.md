# Shell Programming

[Comparison of different shells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_command_shells)

## Bash

The Bourne Shell (BASH) is the default shell in Linux.  It is the first of the Unix / Linux / Posix shells and the one that is most widely emulated.  It was first released in Unix then ported to Linux as that became popular.  In recent years BASH is getting more and more popular in Windows with a number of ways to install it (WSL, Cygwin, MinGW).  Knowing BASH will give a good foundation for most shell programming.  The following lessons will give you some background:

* [Get started with the Linux command line and the Shell](

) (Both modules)

## Powershell

Powershell is now the default shell for Windows.  It is a bit of a different beast than BASH and is object based instead of text based.  It is extreamly powerfull in Windows and a great shell to learn.  The first 4 modules should provide a good background to Powershell:

* [Automate administrative tasks by using PowerShell](

) (Only first 4 modules only)

## Windows Command Prompt

Windows Command Prompt (cmd) was the original shell for Windows and DOS before it.  It is a text based shell very much like BASH and the interactions are very similar, though all the commands and language is different
